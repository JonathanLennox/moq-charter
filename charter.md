# Draft Charter for Media over QUIC

Media over QUIC (moq) will work on a solution for a simple low-latency 
media delivery protocol that is common across ingest and distribution. 
This work may address use cases including live streaming, gaming, and 
media conferencing and allows efficient scaling. The solution supports 
both web browsers and simple devices that donâ€™t contain embedded browsers. 
 
The work focuses on two main areas: A common media publication protocol, 
and a way to name and request media. 
 
The media publication protocol will be a push protocol for sending 
media including audio, video, and timed metadata. It will provided a
mapping of one more media container formats onto QUIC.
The common protocol for 
publishing media over ingest and distribution will support:

* one or more media description formats, 
* an interoperable way to request media and encodings,
* adaptation strategies for different media qualities,
* timestamp of media,
* prioritization of media, 
* optional use of datagrams or streams for audio media 
* a cache friendly media mechanisms. 
 
The proposed solution provides extensibility for supporting different 
media description formats (including CMAF), multiple media types, 
media encodings and prioritization schemes. The protocol will have 
mappings on top of WebTransport and directly on top of QUIC. 
 
The mechanism to name and request media will enable:

* Requesting server start sending media related to given point in the stream
* Cue points ?????
* Integration with captions ???
* Selection of desire encoding ( choosing language, bit rate , etc ) 
 
The MOQ architecture allows for the use of optional relays as first 
class elements of the design. The media publication protocol can 
leverage on-path relays/caches wherever applicable to improve the 
media quality. Even when media is end to end encrypted, the relays
can access some meta data needed for caching such as timestampe and
priority. 
 
This working group will not propose changes to underlying QUIC transport, 
but may propose requirements to the QUIC WG for things such as extensions 
to  congestion control algorithms. This working group will not define 
signaling mechanisms for discovery of relay or media producers or consumers. 
 
This working group will coordinate with the QUIC and WebTransport working 
groups as needed. It will liaise with MPEG, DASH, and W3C WebTransport 
as appropriate.
