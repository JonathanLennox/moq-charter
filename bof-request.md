## Information for IAB/IESG

At IETF 113 a non WG forming BOF was held to discuss the idea of delivering media over QUIC which had participations from 58 pariticipants across realtime conferencing and streaming industries. Since then 
we have had 2 follow up meetings to work on the charter, each bringing in contributions from around 30 participants. There has been consistent interest and participation in this work from developers associated with widely deployed applications including Twitter, Facebook, Webex, Haivison.
